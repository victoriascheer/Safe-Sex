      <p>"I've never worked sober. <p>
  </div>
        <p>The first club I worked at established the mood for a drink and drug laden dancing career. It was a small club in Melbourne Australia. The interior was beautiful with cozy couches and warm lighting, but it was sketchy in ​a 'don't ask, don't tell kinda way'.<p>
<p>My first night, dancers took shots after shots in the dressing room and lined up cocaine on the bar. Later on in the
evening, I saw a female manager snorting ketamine in the bathroom with an 18-year-old dancer. It was my introduction to the industry and I quickly fell into the folds. I learned to flirt, talk, and sell dances drunk. I tried to maintain a sense of control by saying no to drugs at first. I didn’t want to go home coked out to my boyfriend who was already silently horrified by my career change. But after our relationship ended, stimulants and cocaine eventually became staples as well, although intermittently.<p>

<p>While I understand drinking and drugs are central to other jobs as well, such as bartending and sales roles that require entertaining for business deals, alcohol consumption is a huge downside of the industry and, in some ways, I wonder if I have a choice. Of course, no one is forcing alcohol down my throat but the nights are long and grueling and emotionally intensive. The job is filled with endless hours of talking and I don’t know if it’s possible for me to expend so much emotional intimacy sober.<p>
<p>I’ve tried and failed."<p>

      <h2>Sex work</h2>

      <p>
        According to a report published by the House of Commons, the sale and purchase of sexual services between consenting adults is legal in England and Wales.
        Roughly 72,000 sex workers, mostly women, offer their services either on the streets, or more commonly now, indoors.
<p>
        There are many different types of sex work:

      <p>Sex work in its many different forms has been practiced since ancient times. Sex workers emerged all across the globe and were not only part of a booming industry, but would also manipulate or blackmail politicians and nobleman (Harriette Wilson).

<p> Courtesans like Harriette Wilson, who was rumoured to have had an affair with Oscar Wilde’s father, were ambitious, manipulative and smart. Often, they used their expertise to climb the social ladder.</p>

After a coffee and a quick shower, I pack my bag and leave for work. I arrive by 10am and sign my paperwork, which leaves an hour for hair and makeup. As always, I feel a slight tingle of excitement in my tummy.
<p>My first scene partner is heterosexual, which is something I wasn’t aware of and neither was the company. He is Australian and before I even get a chance to introduce myself, he cuts me off with the words: “I don’t f*** dudes, to be honest.”

The director, quick on his feet, decides to make the scene a “gay student seduces his drunk straight roommate”. This gives the guy a chance to show that he wasn’t actually enjoying everything that followed and nobody could accuse him of being a gay.

<p>I am good at my job and a lifetime of experience and collecting knowledge of the male anatomy, leaves him unable to do anything other than rise to the occasion.

<p>Sex is about two people enjoying each other’s bodies, porn is about how sex looks on camera. It is usually more work than fun, especially if you are given a partner, who is anything but attracted to you."

      The decriminalisation of sex work has been a hot debate for quite some time now. </p>
      Feminists such as Julie Bindle argue that sex work is exploitation and promotes the oppression of women. Many critics of prostitution argue that women entered the practice under circumstances which included abuse or economic desperation. Others argue that it contributes to the spread of sexual diseases such as HIV.

    <p>
      Debra Satz, professor in the Department of Philosophy at Stanford University and director of the McCoy Center for Ethics in Society mentions in her article “Markets in Women’s Sexual Labor” that the argument exists that some things simply should not be bought and sold. An example of this are love and friendship, which should have no price. According to her the sale of women’s sexual labour reinforces broad patterns of sex discrimination. She argues that contemporary prostitution contributes to and also instantiates the perception of women as socially inferior to men. </p>

    <p>
      Prostitute Tilly Lawless said that sex workers are consistently spoken over and left out of feminist discussions. To her, being a sex worker is selling a service, not a product: “I do not power away at myself with each work interaction until I’m whittled away into nothing at all.” She argues that by failing to recognise sex work for the physical and emotional labour it is, they forget that sex workers are human and deserving of their living and working conditions fought for. Backing up her argument, Amnesty International states in one of its policies that treating sex work as criminal conduct in many countries means that sex workers cannot rely on support or protection from the police.
    </p>
Below is a list of arguments for and against sex work and its decriminalisation.

              <h2>Journalist Kasja Ekis Ekman:</h2>

  <h4>Objectifies and normalises</h4>
  <p>
    Many people agree that prostitution and any other kind of sex work is morally wrong. Jimmy Cater, 39th President of the US, said that putting a price on your body is considered objectifying women and debases men by assuming that they are entitled to access women’s bodies for sexual gratification. It also normalises the act of buying sex and promotes the image that women are commodities to be bought and sold.
</p>

<h4>Abusive and bad for health</h4>

  <p>Former prostitute Andrea Dworkin calls prostitution ‘intrinsically abusive’. The journalist and feminist Julie Bindle agrees and lists it as a cause and consequence of women’s inequality. She calls it a ‘form of violence in a neoliberal world in which human flesh has come to be viewed as a commodity, like a burger.'
  </p>
  <p>
  She and others consider it as degradation of women and legalising it would ‘put lipstick on modern-day slavery’, according to Joe Vargas, former Captain of the Anaheim police department. Dworkin and many others argue that sex work is damaging to a sex worker’s health and can cause PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).
</p>
<h4>Damaging to relationships</h4>

<p>Some people claim that prostitution threatens committed relationships, marriages and families. By having access to sex workers, it lessens the incentive to enter a stable relationship or find sex outside of a committed relationship in times of difficulties. Furthermore, being a sex worker sets the wrong tone for family life and having a mum, whose job it is to have sex with strangers harms her and her family.
</p>
<h4>Promotes sex trafficking</h4>
<p>People like Swedish journalist Kasja Ekis Ekman believe that trafficking is tied to prostitution. She said: “Trafficking comes in when there isn’t a large enough supply of prostitutes for the demand that exists, if you’re talking in market terms. In the Western world there are never enough women who enter the sex industry willingly. So trafficking is the answer to the question of supply and demand.”
<p>
  Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, Senior Director at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, claimed that legalising sex work would create the same problems as legalising marijuana. He argues that its legalisation in Germany made it harder to hunt down human traffickers and fight against under-aged prostitution.
</p>
<a name="Rachel"></a>
<h4>Here is what former sex worker, Rachel Moran, had to say:</h4>
<p>  "As far as legislation towards decriminalising the sale of sex is concerned, I hold the same views today that I held all through the 1990s when I was a working prostitute myself, and that view is no, I do not support that, because to support decriminalising the sale of sex would be to support prostitution itself…
</p>
<p>I believe if a prostitute or former prostitute wants to see prostitution legalised, it is because she is inured [desensitized] both to the wrong of it and to her own personal injury from it...
</p>
<p>  To be prostituted is humiliating enough; to legalise prostitution is to condone that humiliation, and to absolve those who inflict it. It is an agonising insult."

          </div>
</div>
  </div>

  <h4>Objectifies and normalises</h4>

  <p>The Prostitute’s Education Network argues that no person’s human or civil rights should be violated on the basis of their trade, occupation, work, calling or profession. It states that prostitution, like many other services, offers money in exchange for skills.

  Many sex workers choose this job because they enjoy the flexible working hours, the pay, or simply sex.</p>

<h4>Abusive and bad for health</h4>
<p>In ‘The Mental and Physical Health of Female Sex Workers: A Comparative Study’ it is said that other papers suggested that sex workers have high rates of psychological symptoms which is due to the lack of a comparable group of people and as a result end in a difficult interpretation of the study.</p>

<p>Due to sex work being criminalised, many sex workers complain about bad working conditions, incidents or stereotypical thinking. The Global Network of Sex Work Projects says that without granting sex workers the same rights as other professions get, it will be impossible to achieve real equality.</p>


  <h4>Relationships</h4>
  <p>Stripper Reese Piper said that a man’s relationship status is none of her business and not her responsibility. In the situation of a married guy seeking out the services of a sex worker, it is his commitment to another person that he breaks. She argues that someone who is seeking sex outside of a relationship will do so, sex workers or no sex workers.</p>

<p>Furthermore relationships and sex work offer different things. A relationship rewards with emotional bonding, security, companionship and shared economic resources on top of sex.</p>

  <h4>Sex trafficking</h4>

  <p>In the Netherlands it is legal to employ prostitutes who are over the age of consent and do the work voluntarily.
    The legalisation of brothels enables the government to regulate the sex industry and allows the police to regularly check brothels for signs of human trafficking.
    The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the lifting of the ban on brothels makes prostitution a legitimate occupation and gives prostitutes the same rights and protection as other professionals.</p>

<p>Other institutions such as Amnesty International argue that the stigmatised and criminalised status of sex workers allows the harassment, extortion and physical and sexual violence by law enforcement officials.</p>

<a name="Tilly"></a>
<h4>Here is what sex worker Tilly Lawless had to say in a recent TED talk:</h4>

<p>“Women sex workers are seen as passive victims, slaves to the patriarchy, people whose decisions have to be made FOR them. This is how high-profile white actresses such as Meryl Streep, Lena Dunham, Kate Winslet and Anne Hathaway can think it as appropriate to sign a petition against Amnesty International’s decision to advocate for the rights of sex workers.</p>

<p>I ask: how come faking intimacy in front of a camera is fine but not between two consenting adults? I ask: how come putting up with an exploitative director in fine in the name of art but my decision to work under a brothel manager is not mine to make? How can these women look down from their immense tower of wealth and privilege and say how other women can or cannot make money to survive. Casting couch or brothel bed, what is the difference? Women use their body as an individual privilege in many diverse ways to live in this world and I say USE because it is important to note that I do not sell my body. I do not power away at myself with each work interaction until I’m whittled away into nothing at all.” <a href="#UP" class="info">Back to the top</a>

<h4>Read Sarah's Story:</h4>
<p>Sarah was nine when she found a video on her father’s computer.</p>
<p>It was porn featuring him with another woman. The woman was not his wife, Sarah’s mother. Although quite young, she understood the seriousness of the situation and confronted him. Instead of being remorseful and apologetic, he made her believe that she would be the reason if this family broke apart. So she kept quiet. But over the years she continued to check up on him, without him noticing. She logged into his mail account, searched his history and collected a folder full of evidence of him cheating on her mum with sex workers.</p>

<p>When Sarah gave her the folder, she was devastated but decided to stay with him. Her father promised he would change.</p>
